Authors: Felipe Pinagé, Eulandos dos Santos, João Gama

We have used online bagging as an ensemble creation strategy and HoeffdingTrees as base learning algorithms. The drift detectors were implemented in Matlab 7.10 over Windows 7 in a machine based on Intel Core i7 3520M@2,90 GHz processor using WEKA implementations of the learning algorithms.
